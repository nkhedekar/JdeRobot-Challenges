# jderobot-challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the JDERobot Challenges for the GSoC 2019 Application.

## installation

The details of the challenge itself can be found in [this](installation/gsoc2019-installation_test.pdf) file. 

## python

The details of the challenge itself can be found in [this](python/gsoc2019-python_test.pdf) file.

The game has been implemented as a module in [cgol.py](python/cgol.py) with the game configurable settings in [config.json](python/config.json). The game is instantiated in [sample_app.py](python/sample_app.py)

### Dependancies

This package requires the standard python3 library and numpy to be intalled.

### Usage

To run the game, run `python3 sample_app.py` from the python directory and follow the instructions on the terminal.

To run the tests, run python3 tests.py from the python directory

### Proof of working

Some videos of the working code are available at the following links:
